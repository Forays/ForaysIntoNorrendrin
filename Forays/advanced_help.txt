Tips and advanced topics:

Damage:

Damage values are described as die rolls. For instance, a 2d6
attack will deal damage equal to two dice with six sides each,
added together.


Stealth:

Several factors determine whether you'll be spotted on a given
turn: Your stealth skill, your distance from enemies, whether
you're in darkness or light, and how long you've been within
the sight range of enemies. 

Here's the formula:
Skill * Distance * 10  -  TurnsVisible * 5
The result is your chance to remain unnoticed, in percentage.
(100 and above will always succeed.)
Darkness gives a +2 bonus to stealth skill in this calculation.
Animals and some other foes are harder to sneak past - they use
a 5 instead of a 10 in the formula.

Because of this, you're much more likely to remain unseen
if you stay two or more spaces away. Enemies automatically see
you if you're carrying a light source, or if you're wearing
plate mail and simply standing in the light.


Spell failure formula:

The chance for a spell to fail depends upon your exhaustion
and the spell's tier. The percentage is equal to:
Exhaustion - 20 * (6 - Tier)
